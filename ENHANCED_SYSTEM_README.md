# 🎮 EnvStarter Enhanced Multi-Environment System 2.0

> Revolutionary multi-environment container system with VM-like capabilities!

## 🚀 What's New in Enhanced EnvStarter 2.0

EnvStarter has been completely revolutionized! It's no longer just a simple environment launcher - it's now a **full multi-environment container system** that works like a VM manager for your environments.

### 🌟 Revolutionary Features

#### 📦 Multi-Environment Containers
- **Simultaneous Environments**: Run multiple environments at the same time
- **VM-like Isolation**: Each environment runs in its own isolated container
- **Process Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of all applications in each environment
- **Virtual Desktop Integration**: Each environment can run on its own Windows Virtual Desktop

#### 🎮 Advanced Management Dashboard
- **Container Overview**: Visual dashboard showing all running environments
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live CPU, memory, and process statistics
- **Batch Operations**: Start, stop, pause, and resume multiple environments
- **Resource Management**: Monitor system resources across all containers

#### 🚀 Concurrent Launching System
- **Launch Modes**: 
  - **Concurrent**: Launch multiple environments simultaneously
  - **Sequential**: Launch environments one after another
  - **Batched**: Launch environments in configurable batches
  - **Staggered**: Launch with customizable delays between environments

#### ⚙️ Complete Settings & Environment Management
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, edit, duplicate, and delete environments
- **System Application Scanning**: Automatically find and add installed programs
- **Import/Export**: Share environments between systems
- **Advanced Configuration**: Virtual desktop settings, container priorities, and more

#### 🔄 Dynamic Container Switching
- **Instant Switching**: Jump between running environments instantly
- **System Tray Integration**: Quick access to all containers from tray menu
- **Desktop Switching**: Automatically switch to environment's virtual desktop

### 🎯 How It Works

1. **Container Management**: Each environment becomes a "container" that can run independently
2. **Process Isolation**: Applications are tracked and managed per-environment
3. **Virtual Desktop Integration**: Each environment can have its own Windows desktop space
4. **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple environments can run simultaneously without interference
5. **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of CPU, memory, and process usage per environment

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
