# 🔥 TITLE INJECTION NOT WORKING - IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED

## 🚨 CURRENT PROBLEM:
The window titles are NOT showing environment names even with aggressive injection.

## 🔧 DEBUG STEPS:

### Step 1: Run Debug Script
```bash
python debug_titles.py
```

This will:
1. Show all current windows and their titles
2. Test direct title changing on Calculator
3. Launch Calculator and monitor title injection in real-time

### Step 2: Check Results

**If you see "SUCCESS" messages:**
- Title injection is working
- The problem is elsewhere (timing, wrong windows, etc.)

**If you see "FAILED" messages:**
- Permission issue (need admin rights on Windows)
- API method not working on your system
- Modern Windows app protection

## 🛠️ LIKELY FIXES:

### Fix 1: Run as Administrator (Windows)
```bash
# Right-click Command Prompt -> "Run as Administrator"
python debug_titles.py
```

### Fix 2: Target Specific Window Classes
Modern Windows apps use different window structures. We need to target:
- Main window vs frame window
- Child windows vs parent windows
- UWP apps vs Win32 apps

### Fix 3: Different API Approach
If SetWindowText doesn't work, try:
- `SetWindowLong` with `GWL_WNDPROC`
- Window subclassing
- DLL injection
- Registry-based approach

### Fix 4: Alternative Visual Indicators
If title injection completely fails:
- Window borders/overlays (already implemented)
- Taskbar text modification
- System tray notifications
- Desktop wallpaper overlay

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:

1. **RUN THE DEBUG SCRIPT** to see what's actually happening
2. **Report the results** - did it show SUCCESS or FAILED?
3. **Try running as Administrator** if on Windows
4. **We'll implement the appropriate fix** based on debug results

The debug script will tell us EXACTLY why title injection isn't working!
