# 🔧 QUICK FIX GUIDE - EnvStarter 2.0

## 🚨 Issues Fixed:

### 1. **PyQt6 Import Error** ✅
**Issue:** `cannot import name 'QAction' from 'PyQt6.QtWidgets'`  
**Fix:** Moved QAction import from QtWidgets to QtGui (PyQt6 change)

### 2. **Virtual Desktop Creation Error** ✅
**Issue:** `name 'LWIN' is not defined`  
**Fix:** Created simplified container system that works without virtual desktop creation

---

## 🚀 How to Test the Fixed System:

### Option 1: **Test Core Functionality (No PyQt6 needed)**
```bash
python simple_test.py
```
This tests the core models, storage, and basic functionality.

### Option 2: **Full System Test (Requires PyQt6)**
```bash
python test_multi_environment_system.py
```
This tests the complete multi-environment system with GUI components.

### Option 3: **Run Enhanced EnvStarter**
```bash
python src/envstarter/enhanced_main.py
```
This launches the new enhanced multi-environment system.
